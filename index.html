        <h1>Dear Yasiska 💖</h1>
        <p>This is a special greeting from your Ezhil 💖</p>
        <p>We are studying together in Chettinadu Public School, and every moment with you is magical 🌟 Yasiska, you are not just a name in my life — you are the heartbeat of every beautiful moment I live. Your smile lights up my world like the morning sun, and your presence gives my heart a peace that no words can describe. Studying beside you at Chettinadu Public School is more than just a routine — it’s a blessing I cherish every single day. Every time you speak, laugh, or even just look at me, I feel like the luckiest person alive. This card, this website, and every word I write here are just small ways to show the ocean of love I carry in my heart for you. You are my reason to dream bigger, smile wider, and love deeper — forever and always. ❤️</p>
        <p>I made this website just for you to show how special you are in my life 💝</p>
        <p>With Love,<br>Ezhil ❤️</p>
